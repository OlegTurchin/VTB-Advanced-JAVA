### 4. Generic types, basic collections
Concepts of Generalization and Specialization in Java. Generics, Inheritance, and Subtypes.
Limitations when working with Generic types in Java. Collection Framework introduction.`List` interface and it's realizations.
Homework task is to write a Box class that can contain and operate with different types of fruits.
Make operations safe using generic types.
### 5. Advanced collections
Interfaces `Map` and `Set`. Basic implementations and examples of use.
Iteration, comparison and sorting of collection's elements. 
Homework task is to write a Phonebook using Collection Framework.
### 6. Basic concurrency
Multithreading in Java. Class `Thread` and interface `Runnable`. How to create, manage and synchronize threads. 
Write a program to compare single thread performance with multithreading performance as a homework assignment.
### 7. Advanced concurrency
Advanced concurrency tools such as `Semaphore`, `CountDownLatch`, `CyclicBarrier` and `Lock`. Thread pools. Package `java.util.concurrent`. 
Homework is to write a literal multithreading race and synchronize it using advanced concurrency tools.
### 8. Stream API & Lambda expressions
Java `Stream API`, functional programming in Java and Lambda expressions. Parallel streams.
Stream API practice as a homework.
### 9.  Annotations & SQL
Getting information about a class via `Reflection API`. Interaction with the database via `JDBC`, basics of `PostgreSQL`.
Homework task is to mark up the class with a set of your own annotations and write an annotation handler to build a table in the database and fill it based on these annotations.
### 10. PostrgeSQL
Theory and practice of `PostgreSQL`. Same for homework. Nothing to write home about.
### 11. Hibernate basics
Java `Persistence API`. Basics of using `Hibernate`, entities, cascade operations, relations `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@ManyToMany`.
As homework, one should write a program to store information about customers, goods and purchases of goods by customers in tables, and perform operations on this data.
### 12. Hibernate advanced
Hibernate annotations. `Optimistic` and `Pessimistic` locks. Comparing of optimistic and pessimistic lock on practice as a homework. 
### 13. Spring Core basics
Introduction to the `Spring Framework`. Concept of `Inversion of control`, and it's implementation in Spring  - `Dependency injection`. Concept of `Bean`. Spring configuration. Homework is to build a simple shop CMS prototype using the Spring Framework to reinforce new knowledge. 
- ### From now on and until the end of this course (and even beyond this course), this prototype will be scaled more and more using newly learned technologies.
### 14. Spring Core advanced
Deeper dive into `Spring boot`, `Flyway` as a way to manage our DB migrations, basics of `Spring security`, Thymeleaf Java template engine. As a homework task, removal and filtering functions have to be implemented.
### 15. Spring Data
Spring Data repositories, dynamic queries, Spring Data JPA, entity managers. As a homework, transfer all work with entities to repositories, implement pagination and filters according to the specification.
